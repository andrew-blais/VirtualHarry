It all started with a platitude and a simple question.

Since computers are just ones and zeros, how does that work?

How does that work more exactly?

The logic and arithmetic is relatively easy. 

But, how does it do what it does with ones and zeros so that it computes?

The platitude has it that it is done with switches, like relays.

On. And. Off.

How is that? More exactly?

Be my Google.

Computer. Relay.

There was Harry Porter the third and his relay computer.

Harry made a computer out relays. Not a complicated one, but a computer.

There in four cabinets was something I figured I could figure out.

In order to do this, I started to write a program that simulated Harry's relay computer.

This program is Virtual Harry.

Ecce Harry.
